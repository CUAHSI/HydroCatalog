* One for a large list of sites (Release, SetupWsMontitors)
* onw for a small list of sites (SDSCServices, SetupSDSCMonitors)
The Debug is set to 0, so it will only run once.

When Packaging, use:
* Release > SetupWSMonitors
* SDSCServices

Inside the HisWaterWebServicesAgent/WaterWebServicesAgent.cs,
